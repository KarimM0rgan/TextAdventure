# ðŸ§­ Text Adventure

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

By completing this project, I aimed to:
- Implement multiple custom Java classes (`Monster`, `Weapon`, `Room`)
- Practice using `ArrayList` and the Java Collections API
- Develop a playable, object-oriented text adventure game
- Gain experience using tests to guide class design and functionality

---

## ðŸŽ® Playing the Game

1. Select **Run** to launch the game in the console window/ terminal
2. Use commands like `go`, `take`, and `attack` to explore rooms, collect treasures, and fight monsters

The game runs in a fantasy-like environment structured around interconnected **rooms**, each of which may contain **monsters**, **weapons**, or **treasures**.

### ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
- How to manage relationships between objects (e.g., rooms and their connections)
- More advanced use of collections (`ArrayList`) and object composition
- Designing a game world through class relationships and logic gates
- Importance of helper methods and class modularity

## ðŸŽ¨ Custom Features

I added two creative features to the game:

- ðŸ§¾ **Scoreboard**: Displays collected treasures to the player
- ðŸ›‘ **Room Blocking Mechanic**: Players cannot leave a room until they defeat the monster inside, adding strategic pressure
